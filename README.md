## Reflection
This project highlights key concepts from my degree, including:
- **Mobile App Development** using React Native.
- **User-Centered Design** with accessibility considerations.
- **Software Engineering Best Practices**, focusing on modular code and testing.
Future improvements include complete integration between badge tracking and walk distance data, visualizing walk distance data through interactive graphs for a more engaging and user-friendly design, enhanced navigation, and more comprehensive testing.
